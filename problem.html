        <h3>POVERTY</h3>
        <p id = "firstparagraph"> Poverty contributes hugely to Child marriage. Child brides are deprived of the chance to develop, study, and reach their full potential. Girls are most disadvantaged in underdeveloped nations with limited economic options. Even education can be difficult to obtain. Without enough resources being accessible to them, it is difficult to avoid their fate.

        <h3>HEALTH RISKS</h3>
        <p id = "secondparagraph"> These young wives go through forced pregancies. It poses a huge health risk for them and the baby because their bodies are not fully developed yet. A lot of times, the babies are born with complications. They are at higher risk of dying and malnourishment. Not only that, but these girls are often susceptable to sexually transmitted diseases like HIV/AIDS.

        <h3>VIOLENCE</h3>
        <p id = "thirdparagraph">  Without the security of laws and the government, many brides experience domestic and sexual violence. Even if laws are in place, they are not enforced. Girls lack social support and mobility. Considering how in developing countries, traditional and misogynistic values are still held, these girls can't fight back. These things are normalized.
