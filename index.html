      <p id="mainparagraph"> Child marriage is a worldwide problem. And it has disastrous repercussions everywhere
        because it is driven by Gender Inequality and social norms. The root of this issue lies in the idea that girls
        are less valuable than boys. The lack of education, security, and poverty makes it worse. The goal is to give
        girls access to tools that will help them take power over their own lifes and will give them a voice.
